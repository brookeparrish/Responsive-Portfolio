                    Hi! My name is Brooke Parrish and I am 28 years old. I am originally from El Centro, California and
                    currently reside in Tempe, Arizona. I have a shih tzu named Hagrid, who I absolutely adore.
                    Unfortunately, he lives with my parents in Yuma, Arizona. My hobbies include traveling to new
                    places, going to concerts and dancing country swing.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                I have attended a few different Junior Colleges and received my Bachelor's Degree in Psychology from San
                Diego State. I moved to Phoenix to work for the Department of Child Services but soon realized that
                field of work was not for me. Currently, I work in the front office of a dental lab. My duties include
                disinfecting, scheduling and invoicing cases. I also provide excellent customer service to all of our
                dentists.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although, I like what I currently do, I have come to a dead end and have no more room for advancement. I
                started to practice software with codecademy and it really caught my eye. I hope to absorb as much as I
                can from this course and make a total career change.
